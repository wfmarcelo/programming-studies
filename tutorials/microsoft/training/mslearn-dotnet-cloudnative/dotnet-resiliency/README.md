# Adding resiliency to eShopLite

The code in this repository supports a Learn module focused on *resiliency*, which is the ability of an application or service to handle problems. Resiliency helps make your app fault-tolerant in a way that has the lowest possible impact on the user. The following resilience approaches are explored:

* Using a code-based approach
* Using an infrastructure-based approach

You'll modify this app to include some code-based resiliency handling policies in a microservice. You'll also reconfigure your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment to implement an infrastructure-based solution.
